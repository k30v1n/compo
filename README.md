# compo
Testing a composition approach in a simple problem.

## the problem
Initially you have a Person that lives, walk and speak. And also a Cellphone, that send text messages and do calls.
The problem is that now we want to have a Robotphone, this is a robot that can walk, speak, send text and do calls, but he doesn't lives.

## the limitation of common hierarchy
In C# you cannot derive from two objects. Because the hierarchy defines what an object IS and not what it can DO. 
And then to solve this problem it may need some work arounds to have some reusable code.
